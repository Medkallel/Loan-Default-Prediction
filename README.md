## Description
This project is focused on building an app that estimates the probability of default for each client based on their characteristics. Then create a CI/CD pipeline to deploy it with AWS Elastic Container Service

### Objectives
The main objective of this project is build an image and a pipeline with all the necessary tools to achieve the deployment of a predictive app. The specific steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Filtering and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Model Engineering**: Test at least two classification algorithms.
3. **Model Tracking**: Tracking the metrics and artifacts of the model with MLflow.
4. **App Deployment**: Create a CI/CD pipeline.
